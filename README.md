In this project, I have used MERN stack to develop the web application. I have also implemented CRUD operations to perform add, update, remove operation over the products so that user can add the product to the cart by checking the product details such as price, description, status(available, out of stock) &amp; quantity. This web application is hosted as an E-commerce site over heroku.
